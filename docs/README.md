### Local Development

npm install 
npm run start
```
By default, a browser window will open at http://localhost:3000.
This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
npm run build

```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
